## Main Uses

### Meny

The Meny section is where your weekly meal planning takes place. Easily organize your menu for the week by adding meals to specific days. You can even adjust the portions for each meal according to your needs. Not sure which day to have a particular meal? No worries! There's an "Undecided" category to keep those meals until you decide.

When cooking, follow your recipe by clicking on it and then check the items and instructions as you go.

### Maträtter

In the Maträtter section, you'll find your stored recipes. You have the flexibility to search recipes by name, ingredient, or instruction, making it easy to find the perfect dish for any occasion. When you find a recipe you like, click the "Add to menu" button. The application will automatically add the necessary ingredients to your shopping list! You can also filter and search for recipes that are shared by other users.

From the search page, new recipes can be added. Write them yourself from scratch or import a recipe from a selection of popular swedish recipe websites.
You can also edit existing recipes.

### Varor

Not all items you need to buy are part of a recipe. The Varor section allows you to add additional items to your shopping list that aren't associated with a particular recipe. Need to pick up some milk or snacks? Add them here, and they'll be included in your shopping list. Some items you already have at home. Mark them so they are separated in your shopping list.

### Shopping list

When you are in the store, use the shopping list to check of the items as they come in the store.

### Butiker

In the Butiker section you can manage the stores that you frequently visit. Customize each stores shopping layout based on your preferred route. This way, the application generates your shopping list according to the layout you define here, saving you time and making your shopping experience more efficient.
