## Main Uses

### Meny

Here is where your weekly meal planning takes place. Easily organize your menu for the week by adding meals to specific days. You can even adjust the portions for each meal according to your needs. Open a recipe to check of the items and instructions as you cook. Menu items that contain additional recipes will show all recipes recursively so that you can access all recipes needed when cooking a complicated dish.

### Maträtter

Here you find all your recipes. Here you can search for recipes by name or ingredients. When you find the recipe that you are looking for, just add it to your menu. The application will automatically add the necessary ingredients to your shopping list. You can also filter and search for recipes that are shared by other users so that you can copy the recipes automatically including all connected recipes.

Add new recipes or edit existing recipes. New recipes can be added by writing them yourself from scratch or importing them from a selection of popular swedish recipe websites.

### Inköpslista

Here you can check of your items as you do your grocery shopping. The items order will reflect the store order as you set it up in your store editor. Not all items you need to buy are part of a recipe. You can add additional items to your shopping list that aren't associated with a particular recipe. Need to pick up some milk or snacks? Add them here, and they'll be included in your shopping list.

Some items you already have at home. Mark them so they are separated in your shopping list.

### Butiker

Here you can manage the stores that you frequently visit. Customize each store's layout so that it match your preferred route. The application will sort your shopping list according to the layout you defined. This will save you time and making your shopping experience smoother.
