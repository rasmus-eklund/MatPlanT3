## Main Uses

### Meny

The Meny section is where your weekly meal planning takes place. Easily organize your menu for the week by adding meals to specific days. You can even adjust the portions for each meal according to your needs. Not sure which day to have a particular meal? No worries! There's an "Undecided" category to keep those meals until you decide.

### Maträtter

In the Maträtter section, you'll find an extensive list of recipes to choose from. You have the flexibility to filter recipes by name, ingredient, or instruction, making it easy to find the perfect dish for any occasion. When you find a recipe you like, click the "Add" button and choose a day from the dropdown. The application will automatically add the necessary ingredients to both your "Inköpslista" (shopping list) and Meny (menu)!

### Varor

Not all items you need to buy are part of a recipe. The Varor section allows you to add additional items to your shopping list that aren't associated with a particular recipe. Need to pick up some milk or snacks? Add them here, and they'll be included in your shopping list.

### Butiker

Keep track of your preferred stores for grocery shopping in the Butiker section. You can add, delete, and rearrange stores to customize the shopping layout based on your preferences. This way, the application generates your shopping list according to the layout you define here, saving you time and making your shopping experience more efficient.
